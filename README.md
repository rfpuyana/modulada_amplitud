# Learning Journey

This is the first time I deal with the Google Maps API so this log is a repository for similar implementations in the future. Since my programming level reaches only the basis I am including a list of Google Maps APi related notes as well as Javascrip basic concepts learnt in the process.

Day 4

From this point on I need to leave my audio files clean and ready in Soundcloud. That will take a bit.


Day 3
So I wasnâ€™t able to make the thing work with Closures but then I stumbled a note about the forEach array method.   
  
```javascript
    function assignListeners(marker) {
        marker.addListener('click', function() {
            array_infoWindows[marker.posInArray].open(map, marker);
        });                
    }    

    array_markers.forEach(assignListeners);
```

I had to create a property inside markers called posInArray. I tried retrieving the position of the item in the array but once it goes to the forEach it losts that property. 

Day 2

Since this is also my first project with GitHUb I was trying to have a Testing branch to receive from other branches in order to test and then publish to Production (master).


I faced my first merge conflict so dealing with that shit at the moment.

Day 1.


Created the proyect Key for the Google  Maps API without issue.  

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#get-an-api-key

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/basics#Region

After a couple of quick tries, I used one of the basic examples from the documentation and quickly added a couple of Markers in my map with InfoWindows embedding the audio embed from soundcloud.

BLOCK
I was creating the markers with a loop as well as the infowindows modifying this example (https://goo.gl/qosuTw). However when the Listeners were created only one value was assigned and I got the following error:  
  
Cannot read property 'open' of undefined

This error was happening when assigning the listeners to the markers with a loop.

I found a reference to an error at StackOverflow

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17981437/how-to-add-event-listeners-to-an-array-of-objects

It seems the issue is about the concept of closures. I am totally new to the concept so I need to grasp the basics and see how to implement it there.

This example relates exactly to the issue with Google Maps.

 As usual I had to review my concepts for dealing with classes:
